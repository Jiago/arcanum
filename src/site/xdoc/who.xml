                The <a href="http://www.crypto-book.com/">Crypto-Book</a>
                project looks at investigating using identity based encryption (IBE) and other
                crypto systems over social networks. We have currently implemented a system to
                send encrypted Facebook messages using IBE.

                is a cryptography library written in Java, which extends Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA)
                to support non-traditional cryptographic primitives, such as Proxy Re-Encryption.
